# ccnp-home-labs

## Overview
This repository documents my journey through CCNP ENCOR concepts using **EVE-NG** with Cisco CML images.  
It includes:  
- **Tiny Labs** → small, focused labs from the ENCOR course  
- **Master Lab** → a growing topology where I integrate multiple technologies  
- **Troubleshooting Scenarios** → break/fix practice inspired by real-world issues

## Tiny Labs
1. [VLANs Basic](tiny-labs/01-vlans-basic)  
2. [VLAN Trunks](tiny-labs/02-vlans-trunk/)  
3. [Native VLAN](tiny-labs/03-native-vlan/)    
4. [Allowed VLANs](tiny-labs/04-allowed-vlans/)    
4. [Layer 2 Diagnostic 1](tiny-labs/05-layer2-diagnostic1/)

## Master Lab
The master lab will evolve as I progress through the course:  

- **Stage 1**: Core routing backbone (OSPF/EIGRP basics)  
- **Stage 2**: BGP & redistribution  
- **Stage 3**: Multicast, QoS, and overlays  
- **Stage 4**: Security and programmability  

---

## Troubleshooting Scenarios
- OSPF neighbor down (planned)  
- BGP route missing (planned)  
- VLAN misconfiguration (planned)  
- ...  

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Virtualization**: EVE-NG Community Edition  
- **Images**: Cisco CML (IOSvL2, IOSv, etc.)  
- **End hosts**: VPCS  
- **Diagrams**: Draw.io

## Goals
- Practice and reinforce CCNP ENCOR concepts  
- Document labs for future study and troubleshooting  
- Build a public portfolio of networking labs for interviews and career growth
